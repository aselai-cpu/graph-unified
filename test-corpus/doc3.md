# Vector Databases and Semantic Search

Vector databases store high-dimensional embeddings that represent the semantic meaning of text, images, or other data.

## Popular Vector Databases

LanceDB is an open-source vector database that supports efficient similarity search. Other popular options include Pinecone, Weaviate, and Qdrant.

## Embedding Models

Modern embedding models like BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 and OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 convert text into dense vector representations. These vectors capture semantic relationships between concepts.

## Search Techniques

Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search algorithms like HNSW and IVF enable fast retrieval from millions of vectors. Hybrid search combines vector search with traditional keyword matching for better results.

## Use Cases

Vector databases power semantic search engines, recommendation systems, and question-answering applications. They're essential infrastructure for modern AI applications.

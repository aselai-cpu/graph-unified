# Knowledge Graphs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Knowledge graphs represent information as networks of entities and relationships. They provide structured knowledge that enhances AI systems.

## GraphRAG Architecture

GraphRAG combines knowledge graphs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It extracts entities and relationships from documents, builds a knowledge graph, and uses this graph to improve retrieval quality.

## Key Components

The system includes entity extraction using large language models, relationship mapping between entities, community detection for hierarchical organization, and vector embeddings for semantic search.

## Benefits

GraphRAG enables better context understanding, improved query routing, and more accurate answers to complex questions. It's particularly effective for multi-hop reasoning tasks.

## Research Organizations

Microsoft Research and Anthropic are actively researching graph-based RAG systems. These systems represent the next evolution beyond traditional vector search.

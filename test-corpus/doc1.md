# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing how we interact with technology. Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables systems to learn from data without explicit programming.

## Key Concepts

Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to process complex patterns. These networks are trained on large datasets to recognize images, understand speech, and generate text.

## Applications

AI is being applied in healthcare for disease diagnosis, in finance for fraud detection, and in autonomous vehicles for navigation. Companies like OpenAI and Google are leading the research in this field.

## Challenges

Despite progress, AI faces challenges including bias in training data, interpretability of models, and ethical concerns about automation replacing human jobs.
